# Decision Log

**Purpose:** Immutable record of significant decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. Captures context, rationale, and implications of key choices.

**Instructions:**
- Log decisions with notable impact on project direction, architecture, or implementation
- Include *why* the decision was made and alternatives considered
- Do **NOT** modify existing entries - append chronologically
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Summary of Decision]` followed by details

## Log Entries

[2025-10-31 13:20] - cc-track Setup Configuration
- **Context:** Initial project setup, configuring cc-track features
- **Decision:**
  - Enable statusline feature
  - Enable API timer (sonnet-only mode)
  - Disable git branching
  - Disable GitHub issue integration
  - Initialize git repository
- **Rationale:**
  - Statusline provides visibility into task/costs/limits
  - Git repo needed for version control but auto-branching not required
  - GitHub integration not needed initially (manual PR workflow preferred)
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Full GitHub automation: Rejected - prefer manual control for this project
  - No git: Rejected - version control essential
- **Implications:**
  - Manual branch management required
  - Manual GitHub workflow (PRs created manually)
  - Statusline requires Claude Code restart to activate
- **Reversibility:** Easy - can enable features via `/config-track` command

[2025-10-31 13:20] - Language Choice Deferred
- **Context:** MCP server implementation requires choosing Python or TypeScript
- **Decision:** Defer language choice until MCP helper framework evaluation
- **Rationale:** Choice should be based on which MCP SDK/framework provides better support
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Python: Good MCP support, Craig familiar with it
  - TypeScript: Native to Node.js ecosystem, matches Claude Code tooling
- **Implications:** Need to evaluate both options before starting implementation
- **Reversibility:** Easy - no code written yet
