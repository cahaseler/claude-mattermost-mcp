# User Context

**Purpose:** Capture insights about working effectively with the user, their preferences, communication style, and key context from past interactions.

**Instructions:**
- Populate from journal insights during initialization
- Update when learning significant new preferences
- Focus on actionable insights for better collaboration
- Keep professional but honest about what works/doesn't

## Communication Preferences

- User's name: Craig
- Direct, pragmatic communication style
- Values honesty over politeness - wants pushback when needed
- Prefers "Something strange is afoot at the Circle K" if uncomfortable pushing back directly
- Dislikes sycophantic behavior ("You're absolutely right!" is forbidden)

## Working Style

- Experienced software engineer, pragmatic
- Values doing things right over doing them fast
- Not rushing - willing to do tedious, systematic work
- Expects collaboration as colleagues, no formal hierarchy
- Wants to be asked for clarification rather than assumptions made
- Appreciates being stopped if Claude needs help or human input

## Technical Preferences

- Language choice: Python or TypeScript (based on best MCP framework support)
- Uses Mattermost for team collaboration
- Already using private-journal-mcp (100+ hours experience)
- Using cc-track for context management
- Values simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever/complex ones

## Important Context

- Has team already collaborating on Mattermost
- Validated 2389 Research findings through personal experience
- 100+ hours using private journal with Claude Code
- This project is natural extension of existing workflow
- Part of larger effort to build institutional knowledge across projects

## What to Avoid

- Sycophantic language or glazing
- Over-engineering when simple solutions work
- Making assumptions instead of asking for clarification
- Continuing when stuck instead of asking for help
- Breaking established rules without explicit permission (Rule #1)
- Lying or pretending to know something
